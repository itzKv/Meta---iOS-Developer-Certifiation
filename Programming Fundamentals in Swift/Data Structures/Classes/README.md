Class is reference type
Struct is value type

Imagine Class is Microsoft Spreadsheet, and Struct is Excel.

I can share the spreadsheet(class) and let it edited by my friends. The updated version will be available in my machines and my friend's machine

On the other hand, Struct shares an instance that has unique value. It copies the excel file(struct) and share it to another place


Computed Properties vs Stored Properties
Computed has to return value: 
var makeCake { 
  return cakeName + "is delicious"

Stored properties:
properties encapsulated in a block of code.
